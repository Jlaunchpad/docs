# XFloki

XFLOKI was born as a homage to the adored Shiba Inu meme coin, Shiba Inu (SHIB). Fueled by the skyrocketing popularity of SHIB and other meme tokens, the creators of XFLOKI aspired to forge a token that not only embraced the whimsical and humorous essence of meme culture but also brought tangible benefits to its holders.

The moniker "XFLOKI" is an amalgamation of "X," representing the enigmatic or unknown, and "FLOKI," paying tribute to the character Floki from the renowned TV series Vikings. This unique blend is crafted to envelop the token in an aura of anticipation and curiosity, setting it apart with its own distinct charm.\
