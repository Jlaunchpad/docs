# Create a Lock

## Step 1: Token Verification

1. Connect your wallet. In this article, we will use MetaMask wallet as an example.
2. From homepage, access "Lock Tool" and click on "Create Lock".
3. Input your token address.
4. Check on the details of your presale token and fill in the "Lock Logo URL" and "Token Logo URL". These are the required fields, cannot be blank. You can’t complete this step without those.&#x20;
5. Logo URL must end with a supported image extension: png, jpg, jpeg or gif.&#x20;

&#x20;       Example: [https://beurl.app/JLaunchpad-logo](https://beurl.app/JLaunchpad-logo)

2. Enter the number of tokens you want to lock (numbers only, no percentages). Or, you can click on the percentage to automatically fill in the amount of tokens you want to lock.
3. Click on "Approve". MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for that transaction. If you agree, then click on the “Confirm” button to finish the "Approve" process.
