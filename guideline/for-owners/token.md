## Step 2: Token Details

1. At this stage, you can review the token details. If any changes are needed, you may click "Back" to edit the information. Otherwise, proceed to the next step by selecting "Confirm Transaction!".
2. MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for that transaction. If you agree, then click on the “Confirm” button to finish the process.
