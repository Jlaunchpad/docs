# Withdraw your Contribution

If the presale has ended and the Softcap is not met, in this case, you may withdraw your contribution by clicking on the “Withdrawal contribution” button.

1. Connect your wallet. In this article, we will use MetaMask wallet as an example.&#x20;
2. From the homepage, click on "Presales" then "My Contribution".
3. Click on "View Detail" on the Presale that you would like to withdraw your contribution from.
4. At the right side, you may click on the "Claim Contribution" button.
5. MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for that transaction. If you agree, then click on the “Confirm” button to finish the process.
