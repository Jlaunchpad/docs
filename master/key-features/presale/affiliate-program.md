# Affiliate Program

#### AFFILIATE REWARDS CALCULATION

* Only the project owner has the authority to set the affiliate reward percentage, with a maximum cap of 10% of the hard cap.
* Rewards become claimable once the presale is successfully finalized.

Affiliate Rewards = Amount of raise token bought x Affiliate Rate

#### EXAMPLE CALCULATION

Suppose the affiliate rate is set at 5%, and the total contributions made through your referral link amount to 1,000 BNB. Your reward would be: **1,000 BNB × 5% = 50 BNB**

If three different users contribute using your referral link:

* Peer A contributes 500 BNB
* Peer B contributes 300 BNB
* Peer C contributes 200 BNB

The total amount referred is **500 + 300 + 200 = 1,000 BNB**, which results in an affiliate reward of **50 BNB**.
