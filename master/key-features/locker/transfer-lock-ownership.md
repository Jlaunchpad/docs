## Step 3: Confirmation

1. A pop-up will appear, check on the details and proceed by clicking on "Confirm Transfer".&#x20;
2. Then, MetaMask will now ask you to confirm the transaction. It will also show you the fee that you are required to pay for that transaction. If you agree, then click on the “Confirm”.
