# Mint Function

## **Block Emissions**

### JLP is minted every block and divided into two main parts:

* **To distribute**: Allocated to pools and reward systems.
* **To burn**: A portion of tokens is sent to the burn address.

**JLP Distribution Channels**

* **Syrup Pools**: Tokens are provided for staking.
* **Farms:** Used to support farming pool.
* **Lottery**: A portion of JLP is injected into the lottery prize pool.

## **Dev Address Minting**

* A certain amount of JLP is minted directly to the Dev address.
* These tokens **never enter circulation** and are burned weekly to reduce supply.
