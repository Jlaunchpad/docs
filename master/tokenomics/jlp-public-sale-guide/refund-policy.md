# Refund Policy

JLaunchpad focuses on price protection in three primary ways:

1. **Liquidity**‚ÄîTeams must believe in their pricing and must provide a tradable environment for their token. Initial liquidity provision should be roughly equal to the value of the circulating supply at IDO price.
2. **Price Uniformity**‚ÄîRetail buyers often have the luxury of unlocked tokens while private investors are subject to vesting but may receive tokens at a heavily discounted price along with a percentage of their allocation at TGE. This substantially lowers the cost basis of circulating tokens, creating misaligned incentives.
3. **Price Protection**‚Äîteams must provide a period where the tokens remain at or above the IDO price.

## Refund Eligibility Criteria

### Round 1 & 2

‚úÖ **No prior token claims or Vesting Marketplace interactions**

* The user must **not have claimed tokens to their wallet** or **engaged in any transactions** on the Vesting Marketplace.
* If tokens have been claimed or traded on the Vesting Marketplace, the user **is no longer eligible for a refund**.

‚úÖ **Market price lower than Public Sale price**

* The market price of JLP must be **lower than the IDO price** within **14 days after the token is listed** on the first supported exchange.
* If the market price is **equal to or higher than the IDO price**, **no refund will be granted**.

üìå **Important Notes:**

* **Both conditions must be met to qualify for a refund.**
* If **only one condition is met** (e.g., tokens are unclaimed, but the price is still above the IDO price), **a refund is not possible**.
* Eligible users can **submit refund requests** via the Vesting Marketplace **within 14 days from the listing date**.

### **Round 3 does not support refunds under any circumstances**
